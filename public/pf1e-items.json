When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor, and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor's check penalty to all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</p><p>An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals.

Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow or spear) made from greenwood is considered a masterwork item.

When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on Stealth checks).

Make a Survival check with a &ndash;10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is &ndash;20 instead of &ndash;10.

If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell (for example, to cast <i>dispel magic</i> on a magical seal in a dungeon) you need to negotiate with her; the default answer to such requests is typically no, since most people don't actually like to go on unexpected life-threatening adventures. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">The price given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component.

This activation causes one of the ring's nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of its garnets that ha sbeen destroyed.</p>",

    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The celestial lens is a 12-foot-diameter lens mounted in a rune-covered circular frame of strange, alien metal, floating in a permanent orbit around a temple dedicated to the sun. Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The <i>celestial lens</i> was created to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the <i>flame of guidance</i>. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle</i> can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.</p>",

    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of&mdash;or unable to tap into&mdash;its fantastic power.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.</p><ul><li>Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</li><li><i>Guards and wards</i> 1/day on the central tower.</li><li><i>Storm of vengeance</i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li><li><i>Wind wall</i> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li></ul>",
